## How it works

An 8-bit LFSR works by shifting its register bits each clock cycle while feeding back a new bit generated by XORing specific tapped positions, producing a pseudo-random sequence of outputs.
## How to test
Test it by applying a clock and reset, then observing the 8-bit output over multiple cycles to verify that the pseudo-random sequence and parity bit evolve correctly.
pytest.
## External hardware
